# Contributing Specifications

There should be a folder called **Design Mockups**.

Inside that folder, you can upload design mockups for the app to use. I will choose the best one to use on the app.


## Design Requirements

This section will answer what exactly you need to design. **All pointers are separate activities.**

1. A vertical scroll view, each row containing 
  - Name of the meeting
  - A start button
  - A remove button
  - Add top bars and bottom bars as suited.
  - Also add two floating buttons at the bottm, one to add a new meeting, one to delete all.
  
2. When you click a meeting in the prev activity, this activity opens. It contains.
  - The meeting name in big font.
  - A start and delete button again.
  - There should be seven enable-disable switch kinda thing, one for each day of the week. 
  - And a button beside each day of the week, to select time for that day of the week.
  - Add top-bottom bars as desired
