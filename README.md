# ZoomInTime
Android Project to help students list their zoom regulars in one place.

### Idea
Many times I found myself missing the class attendance because I would forget the exact time for the meeting.

And when I actually remember that I have to join, I would be scrolling endlessly to find the class link the teacher sent ages ago.


So here basically, you can save your class links in one place, open up the app and join the class in one single button.


In future I'll add the feature of automatically joining the class at the designated time so you wont even have to open the app.


### Features 
- Save the name, time and link of the class.
- Join a saved class in one single button.
- Remove all the classes from the list.

### Incoming Features
- Automatically connecting to the meeting on time in an alarm-fashion.
